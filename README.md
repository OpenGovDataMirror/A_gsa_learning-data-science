# learning-data-science
A repo for learning Python and data science.
# Description:
The best way to learn something is by teaching it. To that end, this repo contains notebooks on the tools and methods of data science.

Although these lessons are meant to be approachable by anybody, a few guiding principles will help make the material stick:
- Learn by doing
- Only be confused by one thing at a time
- When confused, google it

Notebooks are ordered like levels in a video game, with the simplest/easiest material in the beginning and the more difficult/complex stuff near the end. I borrowed this idea from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), which is based on the idea that solving one problem will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined learner will slowly but surely work his/her way through every lesson.

# Installation
This project utilizes [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), although I'd recommended that you download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) to get Python 3.6 as well a suite of tools including Jupyter Notebook.

Once you've got the tools
 - [clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
 - [navigate to the directory](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) from the command line
 - typer `jupyter notebook` and press Enter. In a moment, Jupyter will be running in your browser.

# Usage
This project is still under construction.
