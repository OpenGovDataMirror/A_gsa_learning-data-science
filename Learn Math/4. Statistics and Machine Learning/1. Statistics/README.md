# Statistics
These notebooks will introduce you to statistics. Although the outline roughly follows
Allen B. Downey's [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf),
the code and and examples are mostly my own. I'd definitely recommend reading the book (and his others), but as I did I found myself wanting more explanations, examples,
and practice. If you make it through these notebooks, you should be able to:

- Import and clean and wide variety of data
- Describe single variables
- Explore and model pair-wise relationships
- Analyze multivariate relationships
- Perform hypothesis testing
- Visualize data
