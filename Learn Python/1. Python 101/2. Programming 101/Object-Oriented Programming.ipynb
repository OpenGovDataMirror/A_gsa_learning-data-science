As the values of the program's variables change with each successive step, the program's state also changes. Here's a simple example of procedural programming in action:"

    "When we program procedurally like this, we're storing all of our data in a **global** state. It's called global because each an every variable we create can be accessed at any time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having everything in a global state is fine when you're building small programs, but can quickly become complicated and cumbersome when you start building larger programs with more and more variables. As the number of global variables increases, you can loose track of the variable names you've used. This means that you might start changing the value of variables by accident. This problem led to the development of two additional programming paradigms:  functional programming and object-oriented programming."

    "### The Functional Paradigm\n",
    "[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) started in the 1930s with Alonzo Church's [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). Rooted in mathematics, functional programming eliminates global state all together by relying on functions that pass their output to other functions until a desired output is achieved. Since there is no global state with global variables, the program never relies on or changes data that exists outside the current function. But that doesn't mean there is no state. The state is within the functions."

    "### Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) stores state in objects. What are objects? In essence, they're **classes** of data that contain within them the logic and operations that can be applied to them. In other words, OOP is about programming the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. \n",

    "To make this concrete, consider fruit. Yes, fruit. Apples, oranges, pineapples. Fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a box of fruit. Each piece of fruit would be an object. In the language of OOP, each piece of fruit would be an **instance** of the fruit **class**. All fruit share some attributes, like weight and color, but each particular instance of fruit could contain a different value for any particular attribute. If we were to program fruit, we could define a fruit class that allows us to create several fruit instances, each with various values for the commonly shared attributes like weight and color.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that data (also knows as **attributes**) and their **methods** (the things you can do with the data) are bundled together into **instances** of a **class**. Thus every object contains within it the ruleset for what can and cannot be done to the data therein.\n",

    "OOP helps programmers recognize and exploit common data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider your desktop. It's got a bunch of windows running, each with its own individualized data, but each window shares some common functionality, such as minimizing, maximizing, and closing. In OOP, these individual windows would be created as separate instanaces of a `window` type object. The common functionalities of closing, minimizing, and maximizing could then be implemented as methods of this `window` type."
