When there is too much negativity in one place, i.e. the anode end of the battery, the electrical current wants to travel to a more positively charged environment, such as the cathode end of the battery. But the electrolyte in the middle of the battery blocks the most direct route; and air is not a good conductor, so the pent-up electrons in the anode have nowhere to go. When you introduce a copper wire, which is a good conductor, the pent-up electrons suddenly have somewhere to go.\n",

    "Even the most complex decisions can be broken down and rendered as a series of binary options. Specifying the relationship between these binary options is the provence of [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), a branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are either $True$ or $False$, which are usually denoted by $1$ and $0$, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean Algebra\n",
    "In normal algebra, when we say that $1 + 1 = 2$, we're tacitly accepting a universally agreed-upon definition of integers and arithmetic. $1 + 1 = 0$ seems wrong because it doesn't jive with what we think about numbers and arithmetic. But if you define numbers and their properties differently, $1 + 1$ could equal $0$, as it does in Boolean algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the $19^{th}$ century, the English mathematician [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) developed a mathematical form of Aristotle’s system of logic. In *An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities*, Boole established several rules of relationship between binary mathematical quantities. He showed that when you limit a variable to two possible values - e.g. $true$ or $false$ - you arrive at a whole new mathematical system. This system became known as Boolean algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean Algebra and Circuits\n",
    "In Boolean algebra, all arithmetic results in one of two possible outcomes: $1$ or $0$. In 1938, the American mathematician [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) recognized that Boolean algebra could be applied to on/off electrical circuits. Thus Shannon put Boole’s obscure mathematical system to work in a way Boole never could have imagined, giving us a powerful mathematical tool for designing and analyzing complex digital circuits. This work still undergirds all modern computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, **you can implement Boolean algebra with logic gates**. And we'll do just that to help us make a more complicated decision about whether or not we want ice cream. But first, we'll need to look at two of the most basic Boolean operations: $AND$ $(conjuction)$ and $OR$ $(disjunction)$."

    "In this introductory lesson, you've seen how we can harness the physical properties of electricity to represent complex information in binary. Circuits furnish us with the hardware while computer code furnishes us with a set of instructions for forming a computer program, which is executed by the hardware once provided with data.\n",

    "Being nothing more than a cascade of logic gates, a computer can only directly execute machine code instructions. Because these instructions are difficult for humans to read and write, most programmers use a high-level programming language. The source code of these languages is translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter so that the computer can execute it to perform its tasks."
