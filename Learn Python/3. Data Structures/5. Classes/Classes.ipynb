    "## Namespace\n",
    "A namespace is a system for managing all of the object names in your program. In Python, this system is implemented as a dictionary of dictionaries, with namespaces as the primary keys and then the names within each namespace (the sub-keys) mapped to their objects (the sub-values). Here's an example to help you visualize this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `namespace1 = {'name_1':object_1, 'name_2':object_2, ...}`<br>\n",
    "> `namespace2 = {'name_3':object_3, 'name_4':object_4, ...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, think about what happens whenever you define a function. Behind the scenes, Python creates a namespace for all of the names that you defined within that function. That way the function knows to use the objects you defined within it before using another object of the same name that might exist elsewhere in your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, the moment you start writing larger, more complex programs, you'll have multiple *independent* namespaces. When I say that namespaces are independent, I mean names can be reused across different namespaces. Only the objects that map to the names will be unique. That means our little example above could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `namespace1 = {'name_1':object_1, 'name_2':object_2, ...}`<br>\n",
    "> `namespace2 = {'name_1':object_3, 'name_2':object_4, ...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python the primary namespaces include:\n",
    " - built-in names (like `while`, `for`, `in`, `def`, etc.)\n",
    " - names imported from another module\n",
    " - the global names of the current module\n",
    " - local names defined within a function or loop"

    "### Lifetime of a Namespace\n",
    "Namespaces are born and then they die. This means that your program's namespaces aren't always accessible (i.e. alive). That's chiefly because they are often created at different points in time. For example:\n",
    " - The built-in namespace is immortal. Names like `in`, `for`, `assert` and `del` are always available. \n",
    " - The global namespace of a module is accessible once the module is imported. These normally last until the intrepreter quits.\n",
    " - A local namespace is created whenever the function or loop that it's connected to is invoked. If it's a function's namesapce, the namespace is deleted when the function ends."

    "## Scope\n",
    "Namespaces exist hierarchically, and it's **scope** that determines the order in which Python searches namespaces for objects with a given name. More concretely, a scope is a textual region of a program where a namespace can be directly accessed without using a namespace prefix (we'll see this prefix in action later, when we work with imported modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, there's actually a handy acronym to help you remember Python's scoping rules: LEGB.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **L**ocal:  names that are assigned within functions\n",
    " - **E**nclosing:  names that are assigned within a closure (i.e. a nested function)\n",
    " - **G**lobal:  names that are assigned for the whole module (i.e. objects created at the top-level of a program without indentation)\n",
    " - **B**uilt-In:  names such such as `open`, `with`, `print`, `map`, `zip`, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "A few rules also govern this hierarchy:\n",
    " - The lowest scope is local\n",
    " - Lower scopes can access the namespaces of higher scopes\n",
    " - Higher scopes cannot directly access the namespaces of lower scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a way to visualize these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/namespaces.png' height = 500 width = 500>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's say you reference a particular name. If this name cannot be found in the local namespace(s), Python moves the search to any enclosing namespaces. If the search in the enclosed scope is also unsuccessful, Python searches the global namespace next. If the global namespace doesn't have the name, Python will then search the built-in namespace. Finally, if the name isn't a built-in name, a `NameError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in action, consider this code, which comes straight from the official Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#scopes-and-namespaces-example)."
